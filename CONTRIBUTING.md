# Contribution Guidelines

We welcome code contributions! 
Adding new features, improving documentation, fixing bugs, or writing tutorials are all examples of helpful contributions. 
Furthermore, if you are using the package in your own application, we strongly encourage you to add it to 
the NL2Flow [Wiki](https://github.ibm.com/aicl/nl2flow/wiki) so that others may also learn from it.

Bug fixes and new features can be initiated through GitHub pull requests or PRs. Before starting work on it, please
make sure to [open an issue](https://github.ibm.com/aicl/nl2flow/issues/new/choose) in an appropriate catogory 
and discuss the proposed contribution with the maintainers of the repository.
When making code contributions to NL2Flow, we ask that you provide unit tests for the new features.
Note that we follow the PEP 8 coding standard and you will not be able to push a commit unless your code passes
the formatting, linting, and static typing checks.

This project uses DCO. Be sure to sign off your commits using 
the -s flag or adding Signed-off-By: Name<Email> in the commit message.

```bash
git commit -s -m 'Informative commit message'
```

Whether you are contributing a new feature or fixing a bug, you need to ensure that the unit tests pass.
Once all the tests have passed, and you are satisfied with your contribution, open a pull request into the main branch 
from your fork of the repository to request adding your contributions into the main code base.
