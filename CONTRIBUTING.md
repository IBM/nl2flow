# Contribution Guidelines
Your project repository should contain a CONTRIBUTING.md that outlines how an InnerSource Contributor can contribute and any information and resources to get the support they need from your team. 

## How to Get Involved
Include the following non-exhaustive list of requirements for First-Time Contributors to get set-up as a contributor of your project repo.
- [ ] Read the project [Overview](https://github.ibm.com/innersource/InnerSource-Template/blob/main/README.md) to see if you would be interested in contributing to this project repo.
- [ ] Join the project team's [Slack channel](https://ibm-cio.slack.com/archives/C032CQ58K8B) for all questions, communication and support.
